Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements of this application was to desgin a warehousing inventory application that was protected by a login, had the ability to create and delete new products, update the inventory count of those products and have a basic notification system that was opt-in that allowed the user to recieve a text message alert when stock of items were low. This applications was designed to allow users who worked in the industry to keep an up-to-date inventory on there persons, and to identify proactively when an item was low in stock versus running out and being unable to fill an order.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I did a lot of experimentation here as this really is the first time I have developed anything in mobile space. So I had alot of R&D and iteratively went over the UI to see what worked and what didn't. I could use this approach in the future with mobile UI as it really did give me the ability to play with the UI and see how the small screen space really affected navigation and actually using the application.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I did a lot of manual testing to ensure that my code worked. Ideally, given more time and space I would love to take advantage of automated unit testing and UI unit testing to enusre that what I wrote is what i expected the UI to do, and if any future updates broke those results.
